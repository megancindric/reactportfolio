# In Defense of Death

Content Warning: This post will deal heavily with death, dying, and grief

My step-dad passed away the day after Christmas.

I just wanted to start with that.  No sense beating around the bush or tiptoing around it. 

And it hurts.  It hurts more than anything I've experienced so far in my life.  I keep waiting for it to stop, for it to get better, but it isn't.
And maybe it's not supposed to.

We don't talk about death much in our culture.  It's a very hush-hush, solumn sort of affair.  

I remember the first time I really, truly thought about my parents dying.  I sat with that feeling, chewed on it as long as I could, and decided it was
too unpleasant to complicate.  It filled me with dread, that one day they might be gone, that I would have to live without them.

We will all die.  Every parent, every friend, every pet, every single living thing must die.  The moment we are born, we are stamped with an expiration
date with the words "TBD".  Life implies death.  So surely, there must be a reason for death.
