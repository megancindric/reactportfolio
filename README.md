# Hello, and welcome! :wave:

### This is my React portfolio project - a space for me to share blog posts, artwork, coding projects and more!

#### This is a work-in-progress, and I plan to continue to add features to continue to polish & improve my coding skillset :muscle:

### :thought_balloon: A few ideas I am currently working on :thought_balloon:

- Adding manual navigation to About Me carousel
- Completion of Blog page, with NotionAPI integration
- Deploying application to AWS via Docker
- Implementing light/dark mode toggle
- Creating an additional gallery page for showcasing artwork

#### Check back soon - I can't wait to show you what I have planned next! :smile:
